<h2>Rescue The Princess!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A brave knight must fight his way through hordes of slimes to rescue his beloved princess!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players must fight or evade deadly slimes to find and rescue the princess.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
This is a platformer where the player is automatically running through randomly spawning slimes which the player must jump over or shoot with arrows.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player controls the brave knight. The player can move left and right around the screen with the arrows, and can jump using the up arrow. The player can also shoot arrows using the space bar. Slimes will randomly spawn after a certain amount of time has passed and will move to the left towards the player. The small green slime is a basic slime that can be defeated with an arrow or jumped over. The bigger blue slime is immune to arrows and must be jumped over. The flying red slimes cannot be jumped over and must be defeated with an arrow. (Note: the hit-boxes are a bit off, I am still getting used to how hit-boxes work in Phaser)
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
The goal of this prototype was to make enemies with varying abilities that could be fought by the player (though their AI is incredibly primitive).
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
This game is simple, but is open to future additions, such as new enemies with different abilities and different weapons the player can use.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The brave knight is a skilled and valiant soldier, in love with the princess of the kingdom.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The princess has been kidnapped by the evil slimes! The brave knight seeks to find and rescue the princess from the slime menace.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game's target audience is people who like simple action/platformer games. I feel the game is also difficult enough to challenge players, but not too hard.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
The game can be beaten in about 2 minutes with no deaths.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The player must properly time their jumps and shots to successfully deal with the slimes and stay alive.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All sprites were made myself. Sound effects were taken from soundbible.com and are considered public domain. Music was made by my brother, Shaun Lawson, and used with his permission. The Phaser example "Invaders" was used as a reference for collisions and game resets.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This game is similar to any auto-scrolling action/platformer. Some code was used from the Phaser examples "Starstruck" and "Invaders" but did not draw inspiration from either.
